## Setup

Requires environment variables, which may be provided in a `.env` file in
project root folder:

- `NODE_ENV`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OAUTH_CALLBACK_URI`
- `HOMEROOM_TO_STUDENT_MAPPING`

## `HOMEROOM_TO_STUDENT_MAPPING`

This is a json file which maps homeroom codes (4A, 7B, etc.) to student names.
This can be generated by `./generate_students_json.py`, which uses my
[teacher helper](https://pypi.org/project/teacherhelper/) project.

After running that script, `students.json` will be present at the root of the
project. The terraform module reads this value in as a string, and passes it to
the kubernetes cluster as a secret. Then, the secret is mounted into the
application container with the name `HOMEROOM_TO_STUDENT_MAPPING`.
